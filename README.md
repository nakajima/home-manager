# my home-manager

i have bailed on this.

## Setup

Probably want to install zsh first, since the nix one is weird (??).

`sudo apt install zsh`
`sudo chsh nakajima`

- Run https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer.
- Install home-manager https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/#sec-install-standalone.
